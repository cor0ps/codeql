<overview>
<p>If two classes share a lot of each other's methods then there is a lot of unnecessary code duplication. 
This makes it difficult to make changes in future and makes the code harder to read.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>If a duplicate class has been included by mistake then remove it. Otherwise consider making a common 
superclass for both classes or even making one of the classes a superclass of the other.</p>
